# Blog_App

#Brief Description --:
      => This project is a full-stack blog platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to create, read, update, and 
       delete (CRUD) blogs, comment on posts, like/dislike comments, and filter blogs based on keywords.
       The platform includes user authentication (JWT-based) and an admin dashboard to monitor activities and manage content. The frontend is designed using React 
       & Tailwind CSS, while the backend handles secure data storage and API operations with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js.
      The goal of this project is to provide a seamless blogging experience with an interactive UI and a secure backend.
